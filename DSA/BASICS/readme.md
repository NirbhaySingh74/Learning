# Day 1 of Learning Java from basics.

# Introduction to Java programming

JAVA was developed by Sun Microsystems Inc in 1991, later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It was developed by James Gosling and Patrick Naughton. It is a simple programming language. Writing, compiling and debugging a program is easy in java. It helps to create modular programs and reusable code.

# Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

This is generally referred as JVM. Before, we discuss about JVM lets see the phases of program execution. Phases are as follows: we write the program, then we compile the program and at last we run the program.

1. Writing of the program is of course done by java programmer like you and me.
2. Compilation of program is done by javac compiler, javac is the primary java compiler included in java development kit (JDK). It takes java program as input and generates java bytecode as output.
3. In third phase, JVM executes the bytecode generated by compiler. This is called program run phase

# bytecode

As discussed above, javac compiler of JDK compiles the java source code into bytecode so that it can be executed by JVM. The bytecode is saved in a .class file by compiler.

# Java Development Kit(JDK)

While explaining JVM and bytecode, I have used the term JDK. Let’s discuss about it. As the name suggests this is complete java development kit that includes JRE (Java Runtime Environment), compilers and various tools like JavaDoc, Java debugger etc.
In order to create, compile and run Java program you would need JDK installed on your compute

# Java Runtime Environment(JRE)

JRE is a part of JDK which means that JDK includes JRE. When you have JRE installed on your system, you can run a java program however you won’t be able to compile it. JRE includes JVM, browser plugins and applets support. When you only need to run a java program on your computer, you would only need JRE.

# Main Features of JAVA

## Java is a platform independent language

Compiler(javac) converts source code (.java file) to the byte code(.class file). As mentioned above, JVM executes the bytecode produced by compiler. This byte code can run on any platform such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS etc.

Which means a program that is compiled on windows can run on Linux and vice-versa. Each operating system has different JVM, however the output they produce after execution of bytecode is same across all operating systems. That is why we call java as platform independent language.

## Java is an Object Oriented language

Object oriented programming is a way of organizing programs as collection of objects, each of which represents an instance of a class.

### 4 main concepts of Object Oriented programming are:

Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism

## Simple

Java is considered as one of simple language because it does not have complex features like Operator overloading, Multiple inheritance, pointers and Explicit memory allocation.

## Secure

We don’t have pointers and we cannot access out of bound arrays (you get ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if you try to do so) in java. That’s why several security flaws like stack corruption or buffer overflow is impossible to exploit in Java.

## Multithreading

Java supports multithreading. Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilisation of CPU.

## High Performance:

Java is a high level language, Its performance has been further improved, thanks to Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers and other performance improvements.

# History of Java

## Original developer and programming name :

James Gosling is considered the original developer of Java language. He is also known as father of Java. He started on this in early 1990s. He originally named it Greentalk and the extension was .gt.

## Programming language renamed from Greentalk to Oak:

When Green team (James Gosling, Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton) started working on it, it was renamed to Oak. Oak is a tree name, which is considered a symbol of strength and is a national tree in many countries such as U.S.A., France, Germany, Romania, etc.

## Again renamed from Oak to Java in 1995:

The project is again renamed from Oak to Java in 1995 as Oak was a trademark for other organization.

## Original and first version of Java:

JDK first version alpha & beta was released in 1995 by Sun Microsystems.

## Key Milestones:

1996: The Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.0 was released. Java quickly became popular due to its many features such as robustness, performance, security etc.
1997: JDK 1.1 was released, It came with out of the box features such as JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API, RMI (Remote Method Invocation) and JavaBeans.
1998: JDK 1.2 was released, It came with various Java editions with the introducing of Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE), the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE), and the Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME).
2004: JDK 1.5 was released, It was marketed as Java 5.0, introducing some popular java features such as generics, enhanced for loop etc.
2006: Sun Microsystems made the JVM, compiler, and key libraries open source under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
2009: Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle Corporation, this deal was completed in 2010. Oracle continued the development of Java.

# C++ vs Java – Difference between C++ and Java

In this post, you will learn the difference between C++ and Java. There are many similarities and differences between these programming languages.

Before we see the difference between them, lets look have a look the basic details about both of these programming languages.

# C++ language

C++ is the first programming language that introduced the concept of object oriented programming, it was C++ that introduced the whole idea about objects and classes. C++ initially known as “C with classes” as it was developed as an advanced version of C, with added object oriented features as an improvement.

C++ language was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at AT & T Bell Laboratories. The first commercial C++ compiler known as Cfront, was released in 1985.

# Java language

Java programming language was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in early 1990. Java was initially developed for digital devices such television, remote, set-top boxes.

Java project initially named “Greentalk” by James Gosling, it got renamed to “Oak” later. in 1995 Sun Microsystems renamed it again from Oak to java as “Oak” was a registered trademark for another organization.

# C++ Program

## Let’s have a look at a very simple C++ program that prints a message “Hello World!” on the screen.

#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main() {  
 cout << "Hello World!";  
 return 0;  
}  
Output:

Hello World!

# Java Program

## Let’s write the same program in Java programming language.

class HelloWorld{  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
 System.out.println("Hello World!");  
 }  
}  
Output:

Hello World!

# JDK vs JRE vs JVM: Difference between them

## JDK (Java Development Kit)

JDK is a superset of JRE, it contains everything that JRE has along with development tools such as compiler, debugger etc.

JDK stands for Java Development Kit. To install Java on your system, you need to first install JDK on your system.
JDK contains the tools that you need, in order to write and execute java programs.
JDK consists of Private JRE, JVM, compiler, Java application launcher, Appletviewer, etc. It also provides the Standard Edition (SE) of java API.

![Jdk image](https://beginnersbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/jdk.jpg)

# Features of JDK

The JDK comes with a complete Java Runtime Environment (JRE), that is different from the regular JRE thats the reason it is usually called a private runtime so we can say that it includes all the features that JRE has.
It has all the java development tools such as compiler, JVM, JRE, debugger etc.
You need jdk in order to write and run java program.
JDK supports multiple platforms and can be installed on Windows, Mac and other operating systems.

# JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

JRE is the environment within which the java virtual machine runs. JRE contains Java virtual Machine(JVM), class libraries, and other files excluding development tools such as compiler and debugger.
Which means you can run the code in JRE but you can’t develop and compile the code in JRE.

JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. It provides runtime environment for java applications.
You need JRE in order to run java programs. If you are not a developer and not writing java programs, you do not need JDK but you still need JRE to run java programs.
All the JDK already comes with JRE so you do not need to download and install it separately.
JRE contains set of libraries and other files that JVM uses at runtime.

![Jre image](https://beginnersbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/jre.jpg)

# Features of JRE

JRE contains set of libraries and other tools that JVM needs at runtime.
You can easily run any java program on JRE but you need jdk to write and compile java programs.
JRE contains libraries that are required for integrations such as Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI), Remote Method Invocation (RMI) etc.

# JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

Java is a high level programming language. A program written in high level language cannot be run on any machine directly. First, it needs to be translated into that particular machine language. The javac compiler does this thing, it takes java program (.java file containing source code) and translates it into machine code (referred as byte code or .class file).

Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that resides in the real machine (your computer) and the machine language for JVM is byte code. This makes it easier for compiler as it has to generate byte code for JVM rather than different machine code for each type of machine. JVM executes the byte code generated by compiler and produce output. JVM is the one that makes java platform independent.

# Features of JVM

JVM makes it possible to run java code on any machine, it is the JVM that makes java truly platform independent.
It also allows to run java applications on cloud platforms.
JDK and JRE both of these contain JVM.
JVM is an interpreter as it executes the java code line by line.
JVM converts the bytecode into machine code. JVM is platform independent as JVM doesn’t depend on the hardware and operating system of the machine.

# If, If..else Statement in Java with Examples

When we need to execute a set of statements based on a condition then we need to use control flow statements. For example, if a number is greater than zero then we want to print “Positive Number” but if it is less than zero then we want to print “Negative Number”. In this case we have two print statements in the program, but only one print statement executes at a time based on the input value. We will see how to write such type of conditions in the java program using control statements.

In this tutorial, we will see four types of control statements that you can use in java programs based on the requirement: In this tutorial we will cover following conditional statements:

a) if statement
b) nested if statement
c) if-else statement
d) if-else-if statement

# If statement

## If statement consists a condition, followed by statement or a set of statements as shown below:

if(condition){
Statement(s);
}
The statements gets executed only when the given condition is true. If the condition is false then the statements inside if statement body are completely ignored.
if statement flow diagram

## Example of if statement

public class IfStatementExample {

public static void main(String args[]){
int num=70;
if( num < 100 ){
/_ This println statement will only execute,
_ if the above condition is true
\*/
System.out.println("number is less than 100");
}
}
}
Output:

number is less than 100

# Nested if statement in Java

## When there is an if statement inside another if statement then it is called the nested if statement.

## The structure of nested if looks like this:

if(condition_1) {
Statement1(s);

if(condition_2) {
Statement2(s);
}
}
Statement1 would execute if the condition_1 is true. Statement2 would only execute if both the conditions( condition_1 and condition_2) are true.

Example of Nested if statement
public class NestedIfExample {

public static void main(String args[]){
int num=70;
if( num < 100 ){
System.out.println("number is less than 100");
if(num > 50){
System.out.println("number is greater than 50");
}
}
}
}
Output:

number is less than 100
number is greater than 50

# If else statement in Java

This is how an if-else statement looks:

if(condition) {
Statement(s);
}
else {
Statement(s);
}
The statements inside “if” would execute if the condition is true, and the statements inside “else” would execute if the condition is false.
If else flow diagram

## Example of if-else statement

public class IfElseExample {

public static void main(String args[]){
int num=120;
if( num < 50 ){
System.out.println("num is less than 50");
}
else {
System.out.println("num is greater than or equal 50");
}
}
}
Output:

num is greater than or equal 50

# if-else-if Statement

## if-else-if statement is used when we need to check multiple conditions. In this statement we have only one “if” and one “else”, however we can have multiple “else if”. It is also known as if else if ladder. This is how it looks:

if(condition*1) {
/\_if condition_1 is true execute this*/
statement(s);
}
else if(condition*2) {
/* execute this if condition\*1 is not met and

- condition*2 is met
  */
  statement(s);
  }
  else if(condition*3) {
  /* execute this if condition\*1 & condition_2 are
- not met and condition*3 is met
  */
  statement(s);
  }
  .
  .
  .
  else {
  /_ if none of the condition is true
  _ then these statements gets executed
  \*/
  statement(s);
  }
  Note: The most important point to note here is that in if-else-if statement, as soon as the condition is met, the corresponding set of statements get executed, rest gets ignored. If none of the condition is met then the statements inside “else” gets executed.

Example of if-else-if
public class IfElseIfExample {

public static void main(String args[]){
int num=1234;
if(num <100 && num>=1) {
System.out.println("Its a two digit number");
}
else if(num <1000 && num>=100) {
System.out.println("Its a three digit number");
}
else if(num <10000 && num>=1000) {
System.out.println("Its a four digit number");
}
else if(num <100000 && num>=10000) {
System.out.println("Its a five digit number");
}
else {
System.out.println("number is not between 1 & 99999");
}
}
}
Output:

Its a four digit number

# Switch Case statement in Java with example

Switch case statement is used when we have number of options (or choices) and we may need to perform a different task for each choice.

switch (variable or an integer expression)
{
case constant:
//Java code
;
case constant:
//Java code
;
default:
//Java code
;
}

# For loop in Java with example

For loop is used to execute a set of statements repeatedly until a particular condition returns false. In Java we have three types of basic loops: for, while and do-while. In this tutorial you will learn about for loop in Java. You will also learn nested for loop, enhanced for loop and infinite for loop with examples

for(initialization; condition ; increment/decrement)
{
statement(s);
}

**Initialization** : In the initialization part, variables like loop counter (you will generally see i and j in loops, these are the loop counters) are initialized. This is an optional part of the loop as the variables can be initialized before the loop. This executes only once when the loop starts.

**Condition**: This is one of the important part of the loop. This condition determines till when the loop should keep repeating. The loop keeps repeating until the condition becomes false.

**Increment/Decrement**: In this part of the loop declaration, you can specify the increment or decrement of loop counter. This is to modify the loop counter value so that at one point condition becomes false and the loop ends.

Statement: The statements inside the loop body keeps executing for each iteration of the loop until the loop stops.

# Infinite for loop

A loop that never stops executing is called infinite loop. This happens when the condition expression defined in loop never returns false. The following example will help you understand the importance of Boolean expression and increment/decrement operation co-ordination:

class ForLoopExample2 {
public static void main(String args[]){
for(int i=1; i>=1; i++){
System.out.println("The value of i is: "+i);
}
}
}

This is an infinite loop as the condition would never return false. The initialization step is setting up the value of variable i to 1, since we are incrementing the value of i, it would always be greater than 1 (the Boolean expression: i>1) so it would never return false. This would eventually lead to the infinite loop condition. Thus it is important to see the co-ordination between Boolean expression and increment/decrement operation to determine whether the loop would terminate at some point of time or not.

# Here is another example of infinite for loop:

// infinite loop
for ( ; ; ) {
// statement(s)
}
